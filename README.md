# footballStats
This is just a small project for me to learn GraphQL, and React. As well as for me to expand my knowledge in Go.

The objective here is to make a website that is similar to "TransferMarkt", but make it look more modern, and quicker.

Things I need to do/address:
- Find out why some graphql structs/models are behaving differently from others
- Maybe break out resolver code into their schema's corresponding Go files
- Try to simplify database functions
- Field validation for new/updated records
- Dependency checks for deletions (this will be very important for when we start implementing stats and such)
- Proper error handling
